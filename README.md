# CISSP-Oreilly-Case
A list of content for the OReilly
<p>We are going to break this process down into the smallest parts possible.<br></p>
<p><b>Why do we do cases?</b></p>
<p>Many technical exams will test your capability to recite knowledge, steps, or concepts. This exam is different. The assumption is you have a clear definition memorized for the 1200 terms and 90 processes surrounding the cyber security job. The CISSP exam
    tests each candidates ability to analyze. That means the exam writer expects knowledge and process as inputs NOT as answers.</p>
<p>The example is: your company has a firewall, someone will program that firewall, someone will manage the person that programs that firewall, someone will make a business decision on how that management gets done. Your position sits between the manager
    and the business decision maker. You are the great translator from cyber security technology to cyber security management.</p>
<p>We do case studies to practice this activity of translation so that we are better CISO's. The technologist can identify the security components and know how to put them in place. Our job is to know how that person does their job and how it affects business
    outcomes. By practicing this activity before the exam you will stay in the correct frame of mind for the entire exam, which may be as long as three hours. This practice is not memorization it is a mindset that must be practiced and applied. A typical
    person who meets the experiential requirements of the CISSP exam has done this activity for 3 to 5 years. If you are practicing this activity for the first time expect to spend 30 to 60 hours changing your mindset. The case activities are a dialogue
    between you and the instructor. The instructor will catch you when you have slipped into the technologist mindset.<br></p>
<p><b>The exam:</b><br></p>
<p>Each questions will have four options of two inverted pairs: two technical answers and two managerial answers. There will be one incorrect technical answer and one incorrect managerial answer. That leaves two correct answers but only one of these is a
    managerial answer that you are expected to pick across 100 to 150 questions.</p>
<p>A technologist can fake this for a short period of time (about 70 questions) but eventually the number of questions will wear them down to their natural state of solving technical problems, choosing technical answers. The adaptive format detects the technologist
    much quicker that the older 250 question format.<br></p>
<p><b>What is the mindset of a case study?</b></p>
<p>You are sitting in the seat of CISO. The company that is being discussed is your organization. You want to ensure that everyone at the C suite level is engaged in the problem and willing to offer solutions that may have nothing to do with cyber security.
    You will not inflict any of your preconceived notion's, controls, jargon on the business units.<br></p>
<p><b>Why doesn't everybody do case studies?</b></p>
<p>For instructors lectures are easy but interacting with a student is difficult. Students want one problem and one solution. Students expect one correct answer.&nbsp; We have been doing case studies for 10 years; the problems and solutions are never the
    same. For most business problems we are given half the information and half the time to solve a problem; we seek "good enough." Case studies mimic the convoluted, ugly real world problems and solutions.<br></p>
<p>In the real world there is no one problem, no one solution.&nbsp; But, the case study process <b><i>is the solution</i></b> to a CISSP candidates problem of how to break down every problem.</p>
<p>We do the real thing because we like interacting with cyber security professionals; lecture is boring for everyone and does not solve the CISSP candidates problem. Case studies solve the problem for more than the exam.<br></p>
