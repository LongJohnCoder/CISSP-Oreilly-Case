    <li>Then along came Marriott . . .</li>
    <li>When Marriott announced its interest in acquiring Starwood, one would have believed that they factored in a $500 million Starwood IP technology value within their $13.6 Billion offer, and that they would have been salivating at the prospect of having
        their hands on the fruits of the multi-year transformation experience this IP represented. After all, while stable as a rock, Marriott’s own system today centers around 1970’s Mainframe TPF technology (MARSHA) suitably kept current via the judicious
        use of the scotch-tape and wires represented by a cornucopia of front-end gateways and the labor intense support of inflexible legacy code, eclectic data bases, hard-coded interfaces, and a veritable zoo of different property management systems
        crying for better integration. </li>
    <li>After last week’s completion of the Marriott/Starwood merger, the news is that Marriott has decided to migrate the Starwood properties to the Marriott system and, aside from some elements, essentially to abandon the Starwood system. </li>
    <li>Although we have grown accustomed to the fact that the progression of history is to always move forward, Marriot has found a way to define a Back to the Future Transformation Strategy under the principal argument that it will be easier to migrate
        the 1,200 Starwood properties to the old Marriott system than to migrate the 4,000 Marriott properties to Starwood’s 21st Century solution.</li>

    <li>On July 9, 2019, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) publicly announced its intent to impose a £99M (approximately $123M) GDPR fine on Marriott as a result of its acquisition of Starwood and the subsequent discovery and notification of
        a data breach at Starwood. <br></li>
    <li>While some may view this as the ICO simply continuing to flex its muscle (in light of news of a £183M (approximately $123M) British Airways fine a day earlier), the Marriott fine and others likely to follow could have significant implications on future
        M&amp;A transactions involving cybersecurity and data privacy matters.<br></li>
    <li>In an interesting twist, news of the proposed fine did not originate from the ICO. <br></li>
    <li>As a result of SEC cyber guidance from 2011 and 2018, which specifies that cyber risks and cyber incidents could trigger general SEC reporting obligations, Marriott released a statement on its website to coincide with a filing of its 8-K. <br></li>
    <li>The statement reiterated details of the breach that dated back to 2014 in which the personal information of almost 400 million Starwood guests was exposed, of which about 30 million were in the European Economic Area (EEA) and seven million were in
        the UK. <br></li>
    <li>The breach was discovered in November 2018. <br></li>
    <li>Following the Marriott disclosure, the ICO released its own statement about the fine, noting that Marriott and British Airways had been provided “a confidential notice of intent and they had market obligations to disclose it. <br></li>
    <li>They decided. So we followed up with a statement. That’s why you don’t see the full report with all the details. Usually this is a confidential exchange.”

        looked at the public filings and associated cyber risk disclosures of Marriott.&nbsp; The data breach was noticed on September 8, 2018. Marriott filed the 10-Q covering the period ending September 30, 2018 on Nov 6, 2018. Marriott then filed a
        form 8-K on November 30, 2018, disclosing the cyber-attack. A form 8-K is supposed to be filed within three days of the relevant material corporate event and for other types of news the company is capable of acting quickly. For example, when Senator
        Mitt Romney resigned from the board of Marriott on November 8, 2018, a Form 8-K was filed on November 9, 2018.</li>
    <li>Marriott Chief Financial Officer Leeny Oberg said at an investor conference on Dec. 5 that it was too early to estimate how much the hack would cost, and that the company was already stepping up investments in cyber-security prior to discovering the
        breach. Marriott hired a new chief information security officer in January, and its most recent proxy statement included a description of the board’s oversight of cyber risks that wasn’t present in previous filings.</li>
    <li>Kim, the Marriott spokeswoman, declined to comment on the nature of the company’s investments in security, and said Marriott updates risk-factor disclosures as they change.</li>
    <li>Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson testified in front of a US Senate subcommittee yesterday, revealing new details about a security breach the hotel chain disclosed last year.</li>
    <li>According to a prepared statement for his testimony, Sorenson said that the first time when Marriott learned that something might be wrong was on September 8, last year, when they were contacted by Accenture, the IT company that was managing the Starwood
        guest reservation database.</li>
    <li>Marriott had previously acquired the Starwood hotels chain in September 2016 and was working on a plan to migrate its customers to its own guest reservation system, but at that time, the Starwood system was still separate from the rest of the Marriott
        network.</li>
    <li>But on September 8, Accenture told Marriott's IT staff that one of their security products, a database monitoring system called IBM Guardium, had detected an anomaly on the Starwood guest reservation database a day earlier, on September 7.</li>
    <li>At that point, the Marriott staff realized they were dealing with a probable breach, although they didn't know if it was something big or just the beginning of a hack that could be very easily contained before the attackers accessed any user data.</li>
    <li>The company said it brought in third-party forensic investigators on September 10, to help its IT staff look into a possible breach. "The investigators uncovered a Remote Access Trojan. I was notified of the ongoing investigation that day, and our
        Board was notified the following day," the CEO said.</li>

    <li>On September 8, 2018, an internal security tool flagged as suspicious an attempt to access the internal guest reservation database for Marriott's Starwood brands, which include the Westin, Sheraton, St. Regis, and W hotels. <br></li>
    <li>This prompted an internal investigation that determined, through a forensics process that Marriott has not discussed in detail, that the Starwood network had been compromised sometime in 2014 — back when Starwood had been a separate company. <br></li>
    <li>Marriott purchased Starwood in 2016, but nearly two years later, the former Starwood hotels hadn't been migrated to Marriott's own reservation system and were still using IT infrastructure inherited from Starwood.</li>
    <li>In their investigation, Marriott found data that the attackers had encrypted and attempted to remove from the Starwood systems. <br></li>
    <li>By November, they had managed to decrypt that data and discovered that it included information from up to 500 million guest records, though those undoubtedly include duplicate records or multiple records pertaining to individual guests. <br></li>
    <li>Many of the records include extremely sensitive information like credit card and passport numbers. <br></li>
    <li>Now aware of the severity of the breach, Marriott released a statement on November 30, 2018.</li>

        Marriott paid $13.6 billion for Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts in 2016, the aim was to have a bigger company that could compete with Google, Amazon and other online firms that use their knowledge of consumer preferences to gain primacy with customers.</li>
    <li>Modern hotel companies see tech firms as competitors because they function like e-commerce platforms, licensing their brands and booking engines to investors who own and run the properties. They want to drive direct booking, cut out online travel
        agencies and convince travelers to use loyalty points to pay for products from diapers to skydiving lessons -- then tailor their marketing based on a guests’ past choices.</li>
    <li>A few interesting data points that Marriott leadership has shared:</li>
    <li>The programs had a combined 110 million members.</li>
    <li>There were over 4 billion (with a ‘b’) records that needed to be ported over.</li>
    <li>The combined portfolio has over 6,700 properties spanning 29 brands and over 130 countries.</li>
    <li>Then add in the fact that the loyalty program wasn’t the only aspect of the merger. The newly combined company also had to consider reservations, training (both for phone support and local staff at individual hotels), branding, legal concerns, accounting
        issues… the list goes on and on.</li>
